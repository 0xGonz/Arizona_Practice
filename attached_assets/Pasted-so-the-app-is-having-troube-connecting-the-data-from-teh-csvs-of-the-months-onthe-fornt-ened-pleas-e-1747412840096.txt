Thanks for your patience. Based on a deep review of your architecture, here’s a clear diagnosis and fix strategy for why monthly data isn’t connecting properly to the frontend.

✅ Current Data Flow (Upload to Display)

Copy
Edit
graph LR
A[User Uploads CSV] --> B[CSVUpload Component]
B --> C[Papaparse parses CSV]
C --> D[processCSVData() in Zustand store]
D --> E[processMonthlyCSV() or processAnnualCSV()]
E --> F[monthlyData / annualData in Zustand]
F --> G[Frontend Components (Dashboard, Monthly, etc)]
🧨 Likely Failure Points (Why It’s Breaking)
processMonthlyCSV() might not be properly storing data by month key
→ You’re uploading January, but the frontend isn’t seeing it as monthlyData["January"].

Missing normalized shape for each month in Zustand
→ The store should store a map like:

ts
Copy
Edit
monthlyData = {
  "january": [{ Line Item: "Revenue", Total: "$123,000", ... }],
  "february": [...],
}
But it may be flat or overwritten.

Frontend components are not referencing monthlyData[month] correctly
→ They might expect a flat array instead of the month-keyed object.

✅ Fix Strategy: Clean Modular Monthly CSV Integration
🛠️ Step 1: Update Zustand processCSVData Logic
Ensure you're storing each month properly by type (monthly-e, monthly-o) and month (like "january"):

ts
Copy
Edit
processCSVData: (type, month, raw) => {
  if (type === 'annual') {
    const normalized = processAnnualCSV(raw);
    set({ annualData: normalized });
  } else {
    const normalized = processMonthlyCSV(raw);
    set(state => {
      const key = type === 'monthly-e' ? 'employeeMonthly' : 'otherMonthly';
      return {
        [key]: {
          ...state[key],
          [month?.toLowerCase() || "unknown"]: normalized,
        },
      };
    });
  }
},
This structure ensures:

ts
Copy
Edit
employeeMonthly = {
  january: [...],
  february: [...],
}
🛠️ Step 2: Modify Frontend Monthly.tsx or Chart Code
Use the month selection to access monthlyData[month]:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const { employeeMonthly, otherMonthly } = useStore();
const data = view === 'employee' ? employeeMonthly[month] : otherMonthly[month];
✅ Bonus: Validate that month is lowercase to match store keys.

🛠️ Step 3: Add Debugging UI (Optional)
Inside Upload.tsx, after upload, log what you stored:

tsx
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Current monthly data:", employeeMonthly);
}, [employeeMonthly]);
🧱 Recommended Data Structure in Store
ts
Copy
Edit
type Store = {
  annualData: AnnualCSVRow[],
  employeeMonthly: Record<string, MonthlyCSVRow[]>,
  otherMonthly: Record<string, MonthlyCSVRow[]>,
  ...
}
✅ Summary: Your Modular Monthly Upload Fix
Fix Step	What to Do
🧠 Zustand Fix	Store each CSV by month.toLowerCase() under correct type
⚙️ Frontend Fix	Access correct month via monthlyData[month]
✅ Format Check	Validate that CSV headers and line items align
🧪 Debug View	Log store contents after upload
