Thought for 8 seconds
What the new console dump is screaming
Sequence	What happened	Why it matters
1 Successfully loaded CSV content for upload ID XX, found 205 rows	GET /api/uploads/:id returned the raw CSV, React parsed it in memory.	So the file is reachable and the parser is fine.
2 Immediately after every success → API request error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON	The very next fetch (your “mark this upload as processed” call) expected JSON but received plain HTML (index.html). JSON.parse therefore blows up.	That single failure means the upload never flips to processed = true in the DB, and any downstream aggregation that filters on that flag thinks nothing is ready.
3 It fails for every month (January → July) both on your Mac and in Replit prod	The bug isn’t host‑specific; the route is simply missing or registered after the static‑file middleware, so in both environments the request falls through to Vite/React’s index.html.	

Why the dashboard still goes blank even though the CSV rows are parsed
Your front‑end does two steps per upload:

GET /api/uploads/:id – fetches CSV, parses 205 rows, puts them in Zustand.

PUT /api/uploads/:id/processed – tells the server “I parsed it, go run the aggregation & set processed=true”.

Your summary endpoints (/api/metrics/*, /api/monthly‑summary) query only rows where processed = true (or only the derived monthly_financial_data created in that PUT handler). Because step 2 never succeeds, those endpoints return empty sets → charts show nothing.

Root cause in one sentence
The “mark‑as‑processed” API route isn’t registered (or is registered after express.static()), so in any environment that serves static files the request is hijacked by the static layer and you get HTML instead of JSON.

Quick confirmation
bash
Copy
Edit
# Replace HOST with localhost:3000 or your Replit URL
curl -i https://HOST/api/uploads/24/processed   # or whatever ID you see failing
If you see <!DOCTYPE html> in the body ➜ route not found.

If you see Cannot PUT /api/uploads/24/processed ➜ same story.

Two‑line patch to prove it
Add a stub route above the static middleware:

ts
Copy
Edit
// server/routes/uploads.ts (or index.ts before app.use(express.static))
app.put("/api/uploads/:id/processed", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ ok: true });
});
Reload the app (dev & prod) – the SyntaxError lines disappear, the processed flag flips, and the dashboard populates.

Production‑ready fix
ts
Copy
Edit
// server/routes/uploads.ts
router.put("/uploads/:id/processed", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const id = Number(req.params.id);
    // 1) flag as processed
    await db
      .update(csvUploads)
      .set({ processed: true, processedAt: new Date() })
      .where(eq(csvUploads.id, id));

    // 2) kick off aggregation job (sync or queue)
    await aggregateMetricsForUpload(id);

    res.json({ ok: true });
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }
});

// In main index.ts BEFORE viteStatic / express.static
app.use("/api", router);
app.use(express.static("dist"));   // keep static last
If you no longer need the two‑step dance
Skip the endpoint entirely and set processed: true (and run aggregation) during the initial upload; delete the second fetch in the client.

Hardening so this never blindsides you again
Guardrail	How
React‑Query onError toast	toast.error("Failed to mark upload " + id) so blank dashboards shout at you.
API e2e test in CI	Upload fixture CSV → call /metrics/summary → expect non‑empty JSON.
Route ordering linter	Simple unit test that asserts app._router.stack has all “/api” routes before static.
Express error middleware returns JSON	app.use((err,req,res, _)=> res.status(500).json({error: err.message}))—prevents HTML leaks.

TL;DR
Every “Unexpected token '<'” is your React app trying to JSON.parse(index.html). Add—or correctly place—the /api/uploads/:id/processed route, or eliminate the need for it, and your data will appear in both dev and prod without re‑uploads.
