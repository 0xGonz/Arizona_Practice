## 1\. Overview

The Modular Clinic Financial Analytics Dashboard is a web-based application designed to provide comprehensive financial insights for clinic operations. It addresses the challenge of analyzing data from disparate monthly financial reports (Employee-level and Other Business Units) and a consolidated annual summary. The application will feature a flexible data ingestion system supporting multiple CSV formats, a central dashboard for high-level annual trends, detailed monthly views, and dedicated modules for analyzing provider and departmental performance. Key capabilities include scenario modeling and a searchable insights panel for identifying financial anomalies. The architecture emphasizes modularity to facilitate future enhancements and integrations.

## 2\. Goals

- Enable clinic administrators and stakeholders to gain a unified view of financial performance.

- Provide detailed month-by-month financial breakdowns.

- Allow in-depth analysis of individual provider and departmental profitability.

- Empower users to model financial scenarios based on key variables.

- Automate the identification of potential financial red flags.

- Reduce manual effort in data aggregation and reporting.


## 3\. User Stories

- As a clinic administrator, I want to upload our monthly financial CSVs (E and O) so that I can view detailed performance for that specific month.

- As a clinic administrator, I want to upload our annual consolidated CSV so that I can see a year-to-date overview and monthly trends on the main dashboard.

- As a clinic manager, I want to see a high-level overview of total revenue, expenses, and net income for the year on the main dashboard.

- As a clinic manager, I want to identify the top and bottom performing providers and departments quickly from the main dashboard.

- As a doctor, I want to view my individual monthly revenue, expenses, and net income.

- As a department head, I want to see the profitability and contribution of my specific department or service line.

- As a financial analyst, I want to drill down into specific line items for a given month to understand where revenue and expenses are originating.

- As a financial analyst, I want to compare the performance of two different doctors or departments side-by-side.

- As a decision-maker, I want to use a scenario modeling tool to see how changes in variables like salary or ancillary revenue might impact overall profitability.

- As a user, I want to search for specific financial insights or receive alerts about predefined conditions (e.g., negative margin).


## 4\. Core Features

### 4.1. Configurable Data Ingestion & Processing

- **CSV Upload Module:**

  - Provide intuitive drag-and-drop or file browsing interface.

  - Accept `.csv` file formats only.

  - Implement three distinct upload points:

    - **Annual Dashboard Upload:** A single upload specifically for the Annual Consolidated CSV file. This file's data will populate the Main Dashboard.

    - **Monthly E File Upload:** An upload point within each Month-by-Month tab (e.g., "January") specifically for that month's Employee (E) CSV.

    - **Monthly O File Upload:** An upload point within each Month-by-Month tab (e.g., "January") specifically for that month's Other Businesses (O) CSV.
- **Dynamic Schema Interpretation:**

  - The system must be built to recognize and process the specific column structures based on the upload type:

    - **Monthly E/O CSVs:** Expected columns: "Line Item" (Column A), followed by columns for individual employees/entities (Columns B through M, based on the provided example), and a final "All Employees" or similar summary column (Column N in the example).

    - **Annual Consolidated CSV:** Expected columns: "Line Item" (Column A), followed by monthly columns (e.g., "2024(Jan)", "2024(Feb)", ..., "2024(Dec)" - Columns B through M), and a final annual total column (e.g., "2024 Total" - Column N).
  - The "Line Item" column is the primary key for identifying financial categories and is expected to have consistent descriptions across all file types.
- **Data Transformation & Cleaning:**

  - Implement robust parsing to handle numerical values containing commas ( `,`), dollar signs ( `$`), and parentheses ( `()`) indicating negative values. Convert these to standard numerical formats (e.g., "($15,985.88)" becomes -15985.88).

  - Handle empty or null cells gracefully, treating them as zero values where appropriate for calculations.

  - Address potential hierarchical structure within the "Line Item" column (e.g., indentation or parent/child relationships implied by the data structure) to allow for roll-up and drill-down of financial categories.
- **Financial Mapping & Categorization:**

  - Categorize line items into predefined types (Revenue, Payroll, Admin, Ancillary, Operating, Taxes, Other Income/Expense) based on the "Line Item" description. This mapping should be flexible, potentially using a configurable lookup table.

  - Identify specific revenue and expense line items associated with Ancillary services (e.g., "40101 - Ancillary Income", "67000 - Injectables", "72500 - Medical Supplies" from the example) for Ancillary ROI calculations.

  - Map individual employee/entity columns from monthly E/O files and monthly/total columns from the annual file to a consistent internal data model (Consolidated\_Format).
- **Modular Data Processing Pipeline:** Design the ingestion process as a series of modular steps (Upload -> Validation -> Type Identification -> Parsing -> Cleaning -> Mapping -> Internal Format Conversion -> Storage/State Update) to enhance maintainability and extensibility.


### 4.2. Main Dashboard (Overview Page)

- **Data Source:** Data displayed on this page is exclusively sourced from the most recently uploaded Annual Consolidated CSV file.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

  - Display Total Revenue, Total Expenses, and Net Income.

  - Show Year-to-Date (YTD) values derived from the "2024 Total" column of the annual file.

  - Allow users to select a specific month from the annual file's monthly columns (e.g., "2024(Jan)") to view Month-to-Date (MTD) values for the selected month.

  - Identify and list the Top 5 Earners (Doctors) based on revenue or net income (derived from summing relevant line items across months in the annual file, requires mapping line items to doctors).

  - Identify and list the Top 5 Profit-Generating Departments (similarly derived, requires mapping line items to departments).

  - Identify and list the Bottom 5 Performing Providers / Units.
- **Visualizations:**

  - **Revenue Mix Pie Chart:** Illustrate the proportion of different revenue streams (e.g., Professional Fees, Ancillary Income) based on annual totals.

  - **Ancillary vs. Professional Income Split:** A bar chart or similar visualization comparing the total annual income from Ancillary vs. Professional services.

  - **Net Margin Trend Line:** A line chart showing the Net Margin percentage month-by-month throughout the year, using data from the "2024(Jan)" through "2024(Dec)" columns of the annual file.
- **Reporting:**

  - Provide a function to download a summary report of the main dashboard view as a PDF.
- **Dynamic Date Range:** Implement controls (e.g., a dropdown or slider) allowing users to select a specific month or range of months (e.g., Q1, Q2, specific months) within the context of the Annual Consolidated CSV. All dashboard widgets displaying monthly data should update to reflect the selected range.


### 4.3. Month-by-Month Tabs

- **Navigation:** Implement dynamic tab navigation, with a tab for each month (January to December). Tabs should only become active or show data once the corresponding monthly E and O files have been uploaded for that month.

- **Data Source:** Data for each monthly tab is sourced from the combined data of the specific Monthly Employee (E) and Other Businesses (O) CSVs uploaded directly for that month.

- **Content:** Each active monthly tab will display:

  - **Monthly Financial Snapshot:** A clear summary of Total Revenue, Total Expenses, and Net Income for that specific month.

  - **Line Item Breakdown Table:** A detailed table listing all line items from the combined E and O files for the month, showing the value for each individual employee/entity column and the "All Employees/Entities" total. The table should reflect the hierarchical structure of line items as present in the CSV.

  - **Entity-Level Performance:**

    - **Doctor-Specific Chart:** A chart (e.g., bar or stacked bar) showing revenue and expenses for individual doctors listed in the E file for that month.

    - **Department-Specific Profit/Loss:** Display profit/loss figures for departments or business units listed in the O file (requires mapping entities to departments).

    - **Cost-to-Collection Ratios:** (If collectible data is available or can be derived from the uploaded data).

    - **Trend Sparkline:** A small, inline sparkline chart next to each doctor or service line showing their performance trend. _Initial implementation may show a single month's data or a placeholder; future enhancements could incorporate historical monthly uploads for true trend visualization._
- **Data Drill-Down:** Allow users to click on a parent line item in the Line Item Breakdown Table to expand/collapse sub-items, reflecting the hierarchy from the CSV.


### 4.4. Doctor Performance Module

- **Contextual Data Source:** This module should be accessible from both the Main Dashboard and individual Month-by-Month tabs.

  - When accessed from the Main Dashboard, it uses data aggregated from the Annual Consolidated CSV.

  - When accessed from a Month-by-Month tab, it uses data from that specific month's combined E and O CSV uploads.
- **Filtering:** Allow users to select one or more providers from a dropdown or list (dynamically populated based on the available data in the selected context - annual or monthly).

- **Visualizations & Data Points:** For the selected provider(s):

  - **Profitability Chart:** A bar chart showing the Net Income (or Gross Profit) generated by the provider.

  - **Compensation vs. Revenue Bubble Chart:** A bubble chart plotting providers based on their total revenue and compensation, with bubble size potentially representing net income. (Requires identifying compensation line items and mapping them to providers).

  - **Expense Composition:** A stacked bar or pie chart showing the breakdown of expenses associated with the provider (e.g., their allocated share of Payroll, Admin, Ancillary overhead). This requires a logic for allocating shared expenses.

  - **Monthly Trend View:** If in the annual context, show the provider's performance month-by-month using the annual consolidated data. If in a monthly context, a placeholder or comparison to the previous month (if available) can be shown initially.
- **Comparison:** Enable side-by-side comparison of metrics and charts for multiple selected doctors.


### 4.5. Department Performance Module

- **Contextual Data Source:** Similar to the Doctor Module, this module should be accessible from both the Main Dashboard and individual Month-by-Month tabs, using the appropriate data source (Annual Consolidated or specific month's E/O).

- **Filtering:** Allow users to select one or more departments or service lines for analysis (requires mapping line items or entities to departments).

- **Visualizations & Data Points:** For the selected department(s):

  - **Comparison Chart:** Chart comparing key metrics (Revenue, Expenses, Net Income) across selected service lines (e.g., MRI vs. CBD).

  - **Unit-Level Heatmap:** A heatmap visualizing revenue or expense performance across different business units or cost centers listed in the O files.

  - **Ancillary ROI Dashboard:** Specific visualizations focused on the profitability and return on investment for Ancillary services (e.g., margin per ancillary business unit, total ancillary revenue vs. costs).
- **Hierarchy Support:** If a departmental hierarchy is established through mapping, allow users to view data at different levels of the hierarchy.


### 4.6. Scenario Modeling Module

- **Functionality:** Allow users to manipulate key financial variables and see the real-time impact on profitability metrics.

- **Input Controls:** Provide interactive controls (toggles, dropdowns, sliders, input fields) for variables such as:

  - Toggles: "Remove MRI" (simulates the financial impact of removing a specific service line).

  - Dropdowns: "Compare Doctor A vs Doctor B" (shows the financial difference between two providers).

  - Sliders/Inputs: Adjust percentage changes for salary, overhead allocation, or ancillary revenue for specific providers or departments.
- **Real-time Recalculation:** Upon adjustment of any variable, the system must immediately recalculate and display the impact on:

  - Net Profit (Overall and potentially by selected entity/department).

  - Margin Percentage.

  - Department/Provider Contribution to Total Income.
- **Data Source:** This module primarily uses the currently loaded data (either Annual Consolidated or the specific month's E/O data, depending on where the user initiates the scenario). Changes are hypothetical and do not alter the source data.


### 4.7. Searchable Insights Panel

- **Query System:** Implement a search or query interface (potentially natural language or structured keywords) allowing users to ask specific questions about the data, such as:

  - "Show me all doctors with negative net income in June."

  - "Which department had the highest marketing expense in Q3?"

  - "What was the total ancillary revenue last month?"
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Configure the system to automatically identify and flag predefined conditions:

  - Negative Net Margin (Overall or by entity/department).

  - Ancillary Loss Centers (Ancillary revenue < Ancillary expenses for a specific unit).

  - Over-compensated Providers (Provider compensation > Provider revenue - requires clear mapping of compensation line items).

  - Alerts should be displayed prominently in a dedicated panel.

## 5\. Architecture

- **Frontend (Next.js):**

  - Utilize Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) where appropriate for performance and SEO (though SEO is less critical for an internal tool).

  - Implement component-based UI using React.

  - Style the application using Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent styling. Leverage Tailwind UI components if available and suitable.

  - Manage application state using Zustand or React Context API for efficient data flow and state sharing between components.

  - Implement dynamic routing for month views (e.g., `/month/[name]`).
- **Backend/API:**

  - Implement server-side logic within Next.js API routes or a separate backend service.

  - Handle CSV file uploads securely and efficiently on the server.

  - Perform data parsing, cleaning, transformation, and mapping logic on the server to offload processing from the client.

  - Implement endpoints for aggregating data (e.g., calculating monthly totals, summing category expenses).

  - Handle scenario modeling calculations on the server for performance.
- **Storage:**

  - For a rapid prototype, data can be stored in-memory on the server or using client-side IndexedDB for temporary persistence within a browser session.

  - For a more persistent solution, integrate with a lightweight database like Supabase or Firebase to store processed data, allowing users to return to their data later without re-uploading. The database schema should align with the internal Consolidated\_Format.

## 9\. Constraints & Assumptions

- Input data will always be provided in CSV format with the specified column structures for monthly E/O and annual consolidated files.

- The "Line Item" descriptions will be consistent enough across files to allow for reliable mapping and categorization.

- Numerical values in CSVs will adhere to the format described (commas, dollar signs, parentheses for negatives).

- The application is initially designed for a single clinic's data; multi-clinic support is a potential future enhancement.

- Performance should be adequate for processing and displaying data for a full year for a clinic of moderate size. Scalability for very large datasets may require optimization or a more robust database solution.
