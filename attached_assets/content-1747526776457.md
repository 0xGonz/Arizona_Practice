# Diagnosis of Missing Monthly Data

- **Database storage vs. front-end use.** The server _does_ parse each uploaded CSV and attempt to write metrics into database tables. For example, in `routes.ts` the monthly upload handler calls `storage.storeDepartmentData`, `storeDoctorData`, and `storeMonthlyFinancialData` to insert parsed department, doctor, and summary data into the DB[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/c8fd7f8cd899c71762e738989587d41b1b37091f/server/routes.ts#L174-L178)[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/c8fd7f8cd899c71762e738989587d41b1b37091f/server/routes.ts#L249-L258). However, in production these inserts never appear in the UI, because the React app _never reads them_. Instead, the front end fetches the raw CSV content and is supposed to parse it itself. In practice, though, the client’s data store is never fed that parsed result. The pipeline breaks: the back end drops data into DB (or not, if no DB is connected) and the front end only ever shows an empty state.

- **Missing front-end processing of CSV content.** The `DataInitializer` component fetches upload history ( `GET /api/uploads`) and then loads each CSV’s content with `await loadCSVContent(id)`. Crucially, it **does not** call `processCSVData(type, data, month)` on the result. (It awaits the raw CSV array, then does nothing with it.) Therefore, the app’s state never gets populated with monthly totals, margin trends, etc. The charts look at the state (e.g. `state.monthlyData`) but it stays empty, so charts render nothing. In effect, uploads appear in history but are never “processed” into dashboard data on the client.

- **Persistency of the database.** The code uses a Neon/Postgres DB if `DATABASE_URL` is set; otherwise it logs **“Server starting without database - using in-memory storage”** [github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/176798c5d38f7094790bab2045a1d8f4e51bae25/server/index.ts#L2-L5). If the production environment has no `DATABASE_URL`, then none of the insert calls actually persist data. In-memory mode (no SQLite at all) means every upload’s metrics are lost as soon as that server instance stops. If a real database is intended, it must be configured in production. Without it, _neither_ the DB writes nor the lookups (in `/api/departments/:month`, `/api/doctors/:month`, `/api/financial/:month`) will work, so no data ever arrives in the client.

- **`mark-processed` endpoint and flag.** The server does include an endpoint to mark an upload as processed[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/c8fd7f8cd899c71762e738989587d41b1b37091f/server/routes.ts#L306-L315), updating the `csv_uploads.processed` boolean[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/176798c5d38f7094790bab2045a1d8f4e51bae25/server/db.ts#L2-L9). However, the front end never uses it. There is no code calling that endpoint, and nothing in the UI filters on the `processed` flag. As a result, the flag is essentially unused. (Uploads appear in history and can be re-processed on reload.) This doesn’t directly cause the missing data, but it shows that the “processed” logic is incomplete: uploads are _never_ marked processed in practice, so any intended filtering by processed status doesn’t happen.

- **Front-end chart rendering.** Even aside from the above, the dashboard components expect data in the store. If the store’s arrays are empty or undefined, the charts simply show no content. (There are no visible errors, just blank charts.) For example, if `state.monthlyData[month]` doesn’t exist, components bound to `revenueMix` or `marginTrend` will see empty arrays and render nothing. This makes the symptom (empty charts) worse, but the underlying cause is that `state.monthlyData` never got filled in the first place.


**Summary of root causes:** In production, the monthly metrics are never propagated into the app’s visible state. The server is preparing and even storing the data, but the client never retrieves or uses it. Likely causes include a missing or misconfigured database (so the server’s inserts never persist) and a front-end bug where `loadCSVContent` results aren’t applied to the store. The “processed” logic is defined but not utilized, so uploads remain flagged unprocessed and the UI cannot distinguish processed vs unprocessed data.

# Plan to Fix

1. **Ensure a real persistent database is used.** Verify that `process.env.DATABASE_URL` is set in production so that the `pushSchema()` and storage calls use a real Postgres/Neon database. The code’s `.replit` file indicates a PostgreSQL module is available, but deployment (e.g. on Vercel or Replit deployment) must supply the connection URL. Check the server logs: it should log _“Server starting with database connection”_ rather than the in-memory message[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/176798c5d38f7094790bab2045a1d8f4e51bae25/server/index.ts#L40-L48)[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/176798c5d38f7094790bab2045a1d8f4e51bae25/server/index.ts#L2-L5). With a proper DB, all `store*` calls will actually write data into tables.

2. **Fetch processed metrics from the API (or fix client parsing).** Ideally, let the front-end load the _computed_ metrics from the back-end instead of re-parsing CSV on the client. For example:
   - Call the endpoints `/api/departments/:month`, `/api/doctors/:month`, and `/api/financial/:month` (which exist in `routes.ts` [github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/c8fd7f8cd899c71762e738989587d41b1b37091f/server/routes.ts#L559-L567)[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/c8fd7f8cd899c71762e738989587d41b1b37091f/server/routes.ts#L662-L671)) to get the stored data for each month. Then place those results into the store (e.g. via a new store action). This uses the already-stored DB data and centralizes parsing on the server.

   - **Alternatively**, if client-side parsing is preferred, modify `DataInitializer` so that after `const data = await loadCSVContent(eUpload.id)`, it immediately calls `processCSVData('monthly-e', data, month)` (or `'monthly-o'` accordingly). This will compute and fill `state.monthlyData`. Right now `loadCSVContent` just returns an array and is not used, so hooking this up is necessary. (You can then optionally POST to `/api/uploads/:id/mark-processed` to update the flag, if you want to avoid re-processing on page reload.)
3. **Use the “processed” flag or remove it.** If choosing client-side processing, either actively set `processed=true` by calling the endpoint[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/c8fd7f8cd899c71762e738989587d41b1b37091f/server/routes.ts#L306-L315) after processing, or remove any UI code that filters by it (since none exists anyway). Right now the flag is inert, so confirm that this won’t cause confusion or duplicated work. If you plan to rely on it later (e.g. to show which uploads are already accounted for), implement it fully: after an upload is parsed & stored, call the mark-processed route. Otherwise, ignore the flag.

4. **Handle empty-data cases gracefully.** Update the dashboard components to account for potentially empty arrays (to avoid silent blanks). For example, if no data is available, show a “No data” message or skip that chart. This ensures that even if something goes wrong, the user gets a clear indication. That said, the main fix is ensuring the data actually loads in the first place.

5. **Test end-to-end.** After making these changes, deploy to the production environment and test with a new CSV upload. Confirm:
   - The upload appears in history with an ID.

   - The server log shows metrics being stored (or that the API returns them).

   - Fetching `/api/financial/<month>` (or checking the UI) returns the expected totals.

   - The dashboard charts become populated accordingly.

By enabling a real DB and actually connecting the fetched CSV data to the store, the monthly metrics will reliably appear after each upload. The above changes close the gap between upload → parse → database → UI, ensuring the dashboard no longer runs on empty state.

**Sources:** We examined the app’s server and client code. The **database schema** and insertion logic are in `server/db.ts` and `server/routes.ts` [github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/176798c5d38f7094790bab2045a1d8f4e51bae25/server/db.ts#L24-L27)[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/c8fd7f8cd899c71762e738989587d41b1b37091f/server/routes.ts#L174-L178)[github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/c8fd7f8cd899c71762e738989587d41b1b37091f/server/routes.ts#L249-L258). The **mark-processed** route is defined at lines 305–314 of `server/routes.ts` [github.com](https://github.com/0xGonz/Arizona_Practice/blob/c8fd7f8cd899c71762e738989587d41b1b37091f/server/routes.ts#L306-L315). The **front-end store and data loading** are in the client code; for example, `loadCSVContent` fetches `GET /api/uploads/:id` (see code in the client store) and `DataInitializer` triggers it, but never applies the result. We identified these issues by tracing the code in those files.
